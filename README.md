# Basic Finite Element Method (FEM) Tutorial

This repository contains FEM tutorial for beginners. It consists of a bunch of MATLAB codes to solve Poisson's problem. If you are not familiar with MATLAB, you can refer to [MATLAB tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab). In each folder, {folder_name}.pdf leads you through implementing FEM codes for various finite element spaces. There are also several exercises to make sure you understand.
